            Shiva (Siva) is one of the most important gods in the Hindu pantheon and is considered a member of the
            holy trinity (trimurti) of Hinduism with Brahma and Vishnu. A complex character, he may represent 
            goodness, benevolence and serve as the Protector. He is also associated with Time, and particularly 
            as the destroyer and creator of all things.
