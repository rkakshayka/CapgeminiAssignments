>SYMBOL Introduction
**********************
Javascript comprised six datatypes undefined, null, boolean, String, Number and Object.
The Symbol is newly introduced datatype in ES6 which makes the total number of data types in JavaScript is 7. 
   *It is a primitive datatype which means Symbol cannot be instantiated. 
   *Symbols are immutable datatype and act as unique identifiers for object keys. 
   *Unique object keys can be generated using Symbol() function.
   *The Symbol() function returns a value of type symbol.

    >SYNTAX : let symbol = Symbol();

Before the introduction of Symbol, it was very difficult to generate unique object keys. 
It was important to maintain unique object keys to prevent the overwriting of values having similar object key as 
this could result in loss of data. The introduction of Symbol helped overcome this problem as unique keys could be
generated without writing a complicated piece of code.

>SYMBOL: Property & Description
*********************************
1.Symbol.for()
This function creates a symbol and adds to registry. If the symbol is already present in the registry it will return
 the same; else a new symbol is created in the global symbol registry.

   >SYNTAX: Symbol.for(key);   where, key is the identifier of the symbol.

2.Symbol.keyFor()
This method retrieves a shared symbol key from the global symbol registry for the given symbol.
   
   >SYNTAX: Symbol.keyFor(sym);   where, sym is the symbol to find a key for.

*****************************************
Let us consider an example where a list of marks obtained by students in a particular exam needs to be maintained. 
The students are yet to be assigned their roll numbers. In this situation, the name of a student is to be used as
an object key. However, there can be more than one student with similar names. This can cause overwriting of marks
obtained by each student resulting in data loss. To overcome this problem symbol datatype can be used.
