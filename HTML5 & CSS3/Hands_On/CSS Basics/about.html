    <h1>Definition</h1>
    <p>
        Shiva (Siva) is one of the most important gods in the Hindu pantheon and is considered a member of the
        holy trinity (trimurti) of Hinduism with Brahma and Vishnu. A complex character, he may represent 
        goodness, benevolence and serve as the Protector. He is also associated with Time, and particularly 
        as the destroyer and creator of all things.

        <h2>Interesting Stories & Legends About Lord Shiva</h2>
        <p>
            Allowing almost everything which is otherwise considered a taboo in religion, here's a God who 
            apparently makes mistakes fearlessly and deals with them in a surprisingly calm way. Whaaaat?! 
            Definitely, someone who is not a sucker for rules, he is fairly easy to please and breaks all 
            stereotypes of being a God. <br>
            Cool, chic (he wears a dreadlock), fun, unpredictable (unlike most Gods), and extremely popular 
            with the young and the old alike, Lord Shiva deals with the cosmos, meditates most of the time, 
            likes to mind his own business, has a crazy mix of anger and calm, and is someone whose stories 
            have managed to appeal to every generation of people. 
            <br>
            Here are some fun stories and interesting facts about him
        </p>

            <br>
            <p>
                It is believed that Hanuman is the eleventh avatar of Lord Shiva. Several texts present him as 
                an incarnation of the god Shiva. Known for his devotion to Lord Rama, the son of Anjana and 
                Kesari, blessed by the Hindu God of wind, Vayu, Hanuman is celebrated for his devotion to Lord 
                Shri Rama.

            <p>
                The mountains, snow and the snake around Lord Shiva's neck is a symbol representing his sense 
                of calmness. Self-contained and content, Shiva is a symbol of calm and peace. 
            </p>

            <li><strong>Shiva's Trishul or Trident symbolizes the unity of three worlds</strong></li>
            <img src="CSS Files\Images\shiva-trident.jpg" alt="a picture of Lord shiva with Trishul"> 
            <br>
            <p>
                The Trident or Trishul of Lord Shiva unites the three worlds a human being is associated with 
                - his inside world, the immediate world around him and the broader world. The trident shows a 
                harmony between the three.
